# Star
## The universally compatable web 3.0 crypto platform

### Background

Many web 3.0 projects tend to fail in the following 3 catagories

1. Requirmnet of an obscure backend language like solidity or Rust
1. Centralized front ends
1. Ununified token that acts as a security rather than a medium of exchange.

The three failures have led to a lack of web 3.0 products used outside of the context of speculation. This is because, by centrelizing the required development languages, developers are not incentivised to create for web 3.0; by centeralizing the front ends, the end products still have a centrelized third party controlling the products; and by having an ununified token between DAPPs, and tokens that are prodomently used for speculation, the medium of exchange between these DAPPs becomes unrealistic to obtain and use for average consumers.

### What is star

Star is the best web 3.0 platform for developers, businesses, and consumers. With star, web deployments and the traffic that those websites have received are stored on the blockchain. This means that the blueprint of each website are kept in real time on the blockchain. Recreating a website, and hosting a mirror of it, is a matter of regenerating that blueprint.

Miners, mirror hosters, and website developers are all rewarded with the mined currency based on blocks mined, traffic hosted, and traffic received on developed websites respectivly.
